  and Bloody Mary (Sarabande, 2003).<br>

  <p>I'm offering a writing workshop in Greece this summer, for 1 or 2 wks
    July 8-25. It's very inexpensive, includes room and board in a tiny town
    called Kissos on the Aegean coast. Write in the morning, beach in the
    afternoon... for more info look up<a href=
