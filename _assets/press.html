  <strong>Blood and Milk</strong>

  "Women who are prickly, sharpwitted, and highstrung, who tend to quip about
  their emotional pain and to act selfdestructively, are the protagonists of
  the 11 fine short stories in Solwitz's first collection.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
  Most achieve insights the hard wayafter independent, even rash actions that
  sometimes bring pain."&nbsp;

  "Solwitz's debut collection is trenchant and unnerving. She specializes in
  dislocation, dysfunction, and distress as she writes about the imperfect
  emotional fit between men and women, cultural displacement, and madness both
  personal and societal. . . . Indeed, as Solwitz traces the jagged edges of
  our collective soul, she reminds us that even home can become a foreign
  country."&nbsp;

  "A flair for dark comedy and the ability to turn on a dime are prized
  qualities for these unpredictable characters; time and again, their intrepid
  investigations lead them into uncharted territory where bizarre dramatic
  action seems to be the only possible move. Solwitz's finetoothed examinations
  of complex emotional states are dead on. . . . "&nbsp;

  <strong>The New York Times Book Review</strong>

  "Sharon Solwitz has been winning short story prizes for yearsit's about time
  we get to see all her characters gathered between covers. They are a lively
  and challenging crowd, full of intelligence, charm, and tendencies toward
  selfdestruction and selfrealization that make them stunningly recognizable.
  Their complex lives pose emotional and moral quandaries hard to dismiss and
  hard to put behind us at stories' end. Solwitz has wit, passion, and the
  remarkable ventriloquial skill to throw interior voices we might never
  otherwise hear."
